    USB Header File

Summary:
    This file aggregates all necessary header files for the Microchip USB Host,
    Device, and OTG libraries.  It provides a single-file can be included in
    application code.  The USB libraries simplify the implementation of USB
    applications by providing an abstraction of the USB module and its registers
    and bits such that the source code for the can be the same across various
    hardware platforms.

Description:
    This file aggregates all necessary header files for the Microchip USB Host,
    Device, and OTG libraries.  It provides a single-file can be included in
    application code.  The USB libraries simplify the implementation of USB
    applications by providing an abstraction of the USB module and its registers
    and bits such that the source code for the can be the same across various
    hardware platforms.
    
    Note that this file does not include the header files for any client or
    function drivers.
    
    This file is located in the "\<Install Directory\>\\Microchip\\Include\\USB"
    directory.
    
    When including this file in a new project, this file can either be
    referenced from the directory in which it was installed or copied
    directly into the user application folder. If the first method is
    chosen to keep the file located in the folder in which it is installed
    then include paths need to be added so that the library and the
    application both know where to reference each others files. If the
    application folder is located in the same folder as the Microchip
    folder (like the current demo folders), then the following include
    paths need to be added to the application's project:
    
    .    

    ..\\..\\Microchip\\Include
    
    If a different directory structure is used, modify the paths as
    required. An example using absolute paths instead of relative paths
    would be the following:
    
    C:\\Microchip Solutions\\Microchip\\Include
    
    C:\\Microchip Solutions\\My Demo Application
