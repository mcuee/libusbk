    USB Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)  (Header File)

Summary:
    This file abstracts the hardware interface.

Description:
    This file abstracts the hardware interface.

    This file is located in the "\<Install Directory\>\\Microchip\\Include\\USB"
    directory.
    
    When including this file in a new project, this file can either be
    referenced from the directory in which it was installed or copied
    directly into the user application folder. If the first method is
    chosen to keep the file located in the folder in which it is installed
    then include paths need to be added so that the library and the
    application both know where to reference each others files. If the
    application folder is located in the same folder as the Microchip
    folder (like the current demo folders), then the following include
    paths need to be added to the application's project:
    
    .
    ..\\..\\MicrochipInclude
   
    If a different directory structure is used, modify the paths as
    required. An example using absolute paths instead of relative paths
    would be the following:
    
    C:\\Microchip Solutions\\Microchip\\Include
    
    C:\\Microchip Solutions\\My Demo Application

    Preconditions:

        The caller must ensure that there is no possible way for
        hardware to be currently accessing the pipe (see notes).

    Parameters:

                pipe to flush.

    Return Values:

    Side Effects:
        Transfer data for this pipe has been zero'd out.

    Remarks:
        This routine ignores the normal HW protocol for ownership
        of the pipe data and flushes the pipe, even if it is in
        process.  Thus, the caller must ensure that data transfer
        cannot be in process.  This situation occurs when a
        transfer has been terminated early by the host.

/**************************************************************************
    Function:

    Description:
        This routine prepares to transfer data on the USB.
        If the system is in device mode, the actual transfer
        will not occur until the host peforms an OUT request
        to the given endpoint.  If the system is in host mode,
        the transfer will not start until the token has been
        sent on the bus.

    Preconditions:
        1. USBHALInitialize must have been called to
           initialize the USB HAL.
        2. The endpoint through which the data will be
           transferred must be configured as appropriate by a
           call to USBHALSetEpConfiguration.
        3. The bus must have been enumerated (either as a host
           or device).  Except for EP0 transfers.

    Parameters:
        flags - Flags consists of the endpoint number OR'd
                with one or more flags indicating transfer
                direction and such (see "Data Transfer

    Return Values:

        data transfer, FALSE if not.
        
    Side Effects:
        The HAL has prepared to transfer the data on the USB.

    Ramarks:
        The HAL will continue the data transfer, keeping track
        of the buffer address, data remaining, and ping-pong
        buffer details internally when USBHALHandleBusEvent is
        called (either polled or in response to an interrupt).
        The caller will receive notification that the transfer

    Remarks:
        The base address and size of the buffer is not set by
        this routine.  Those features of an endpoint are
        dynamically managed by the USBHALTransferData routine.
        An endpoint can be "de-configured" by setting its max
