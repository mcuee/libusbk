  Common USB Library Definitions (Header File)

Summary:
    This file defines data types, constants, and macros that are common to
    multiple layers of the Microchip USB Firmware Stack.

Description:
    This file defines data types, constants, and macros that are common to
    multiple layers of the Microchip USB Firmware Stack.

    This file is located in the "\<Install Directory\>\\Microchip\\Include\\USB"
    directory.
    
    When including this file in a new project, this file can either be
    referenced from the directory in which it was installed or copied
    directly into the user application folder. If the first method is
    chosen to keep the file located in the folder in which it is installed
    then include paths need to be added so that the library and the
    application both know where to reference each others files. If the
    application folder is located in the same folder as the Microchip
    folder (like the current demo folders), then the following include
    paths need to be added to the application's project:
    
    .
    ..\\..\\MicrochipInclude
        
    If a different directory structure is used, modify the paths as
    required. An example using absolute paths instead of relative paths
    would be the following:
    
    C:\\Microchip Solutions\\Microchip\\Include
    
    C:\\Microchip Solutions\\My Demo Application

    Function:
        BOOL <Event-handling Function Name> ( USB_EVENT event,
              void *data, unsigned int size )

    Description:
        This routine is a "call out" routine that must be implemented by
        any layer of the USB SW Stack (except the HAL which is at the
        root of the event-call tree that needs to receive events.  When
        an event occurs, the HAL calls the next higher layer in the
        stack to handle the event.  Each layer either handles the event
        or calls the layer above it to handle the event.  Events are
        identified by the "event" parameter and may have associated
        data.  If the higher layer was able to handle the event, it
        should return TRUE.  If not, it should return FALSE.
        
    Preconditions:
        USBInitialize must have been called to initialize the USB SW
        Stack.
        
    Paramters:
        USB_EVENT event   - Identifies the bus event that occured
        void *data        - Pointer to event-specific data
        unsigned int size - Size of the event-specific data
        
    Return Values:
        None
        
    Remarks:
        The function is name is defined by the layer that implements
        it.  A pointer to the function will be placed by into a table
        that the lower-layer will use to call it.  This requires the
        function to use a specific call "signature" (return data type
        and values and data parameter types and values).

    Function:
        BOOL USBInitialize ( unsigned long flags )

    Summary:
        This interface initializes the variables of the USB host stack.

    Description:
        This interface initializes the USB stack.

    Precondition:

    Parameters:
        flags - reserved

    Return Values:
        TRUE  - Initialization successful
        FALSE - Initialization failure

    Remarks:
        This interface is implemented as a macro that can be defined by the
        application or by default is defined correctly for the stack mode.
