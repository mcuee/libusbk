    USB Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)

Summary:
    This file abstracts the hardware interface.  The USB stack firmware can be
    compiled to work on different USB microcontrollers, such as PIC18 and PIC24.
    The USB related special function registers and bit names are generally very
    similar between the device families, but small differences in naming exist.

Description:
    This file abstracts the hardware interface.  The USB stack firmware can be
    compiled to work on different USB microcontrollers, such as PIC18 and PIC24.
    The USB related special function registers and bit names are generally very
    similar between the device families, but small differences in naming exist.
    
    In order to make the same set of firmware work accross the device families,
    when modifying SFR contents, a slightly abstracted name is used, which is
    then "mapped" to the appropriate real name in the usb_hal_picxx.h header.
    
    Make sure to include the correct version of the usb_hal_picxx.h file for 
    the microcontroller family which will be used.

    This file is located in the "\<Install Directory\>\\Microchip\\Include\\USB"
    directory.
    
    When including this file in a new project, this file can either be
    referenced from the directory in which it was installed or copied
    directly into the user application folder. If the first method is
    chosen to keep the file located in the folder in which it is installed
    then include paths need to be added so that the library and the
    application both know where to reference each others files. If the
    application folder is located in the same folder as the Microchip
    folder (like the current demo folders), then the following include
    paths need to be added to the application's project:
    
    .
    
    ..\\..\\Microchip\\Include
        
    If a different directory structure is used, modify the paths as
    required. An example using absolute paths instead of relative paths
    would be the following:
    
    C:\\Microchip Solutions\\Microchip\\Include
    
    C:\\Microchip Solutions\\My Demo Application

/********************************************************************
Function:
    BOOL USBSleepOnSuspend(void)
    
Summary:
    Places the PIC24F core into sleep and sets up the USB module
    to wake up the device on USB activity.
    
PreCondition:
    IPL (in the SR register) must be non-zero.
    
Parameters:
    None
    
Return Values:
    TRUE  - if entered sleep successfully
    FALSE - if there was an error entering sleep
    
Remarks:
    Please note that before calling this function that it is the
    responsibility of the application to place all of the other
    peripherals or board features into a lower power state if
    required.
